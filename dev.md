<!-- Intro for tutorial for liquid gauge progress indicator for react native, with react-native-skia and react-native-reanimated -->
Some time ago I saw this cool [Liquid Fill Gauge Gist](https://gist.github.com/brattonc/5e5ce9beee483220e2f6) with cool animated web svg component. Immediatly I thought it would be cool to have it in react native. It took me some effort to make it works. So I decided to make a tutorial for it. I will use [react-native-skia](https://shopify.github.io/react-native-skia/) and [react-native-reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/).
